### Hi! I'm Guilherme Neves ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I am graduted in aeronautical engineering by SÃ£o Paulo Sate University and I have researched about interplanetary orbit design using genetic algorithm to reduce the fuel costing since 2018. Today I am working with the development of a Space Situational Awareness system focusing on Space Surveillance and Tracking, besides that my newest research project is concern collision avoidance maneuvers optimization using evolutionary algorithms. I also work with the estimation orbit after the tracking, determining the ephemeris and covariance matrix of the object.

### What I am learning about ðŸŒ±

I am improving my software developer skills, as front end frameworks and web based application. For examples you can note public repos in my profile concern simple applications using Angular and .NET
